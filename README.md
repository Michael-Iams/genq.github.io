# Homepage for GenQuery

This site is built with [Docsy][] is a [Hugo theme module][] for technical
documentation sites, providing easy site navigation, structure, and more. It is
modified from a clone of the **Docsy Example Project**. I'm currently replacing
the example documentation with content about GenQuery.

For Docsy documentation, see [Docsy user guide][].

This GenQuery site is hosted on [Netlify][] at
[https://genquery.netlify.app/][]. You can view deploy logs from the [deploy
section of the project's Netlify dashboard][deploys], or this [alternate
dashboard][].
