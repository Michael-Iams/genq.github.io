GenQuery is an open-source, third-party RootsMagic reporting engine for use in
the terminal. GenQuery is designed to let you quickly and easily pull structured
genealogy data from your RootsMagic SQLite database. GenQuery is built on top of
[Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), a new (unavoidable pun) kind of shell for
Windows, MacOS and Linux.
